      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm a student aspiring for a career in the world of progamming and software development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm born and raised in DFW and I love my home state of Texas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to cook interesting meals, write, draw and of course learn to code in my free time.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I hope some day I can work for an independent game studio, as I've loved everything about video games since I was a kid.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Denton, Texas.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Since I was young I've enjoyed everything about technology. 
        I knew I had a passion for it but didn't recognize that until I started to learn code in my free time. 
        I want to be able to develop those same things I was so fascinated by.</p>
